check out these creative applications for using chatGPT in grasshopper.  Thank you to Peter Davis for the kick start chatGPT node, EACH ONE TEACH ONE!

be sure to download and put any custom C# or ghpython user objects into your special folder --> User Object Folder and Unblock

youtube tutorials will highlight my creative ideas.

you will need to create a .txt file with your own OpenAI KEY to call to the chatGPT script to make sure things load and run.  I can't give you mine!

All the Best,  Michael Wickerson
